"""Consolidate whatever is in the inbox and publish the result.

    python publish.py            # consolidate, show what changed, do not push
    python publish.py --push     # ...and push it
    python publish.py --watch    # keep watching the inbox and repeat

This is the whole loop in one place: drop a submission in `_inbox/`, and the
merged data ends up public without anyone deciding anything by hand.

WHAT GUARDS THE PUSH
--------------------
Everything here is reversible except the push.  A force-push does not un-publish
a leak -- once account data is on GitHub it has been fetched, cached and indexed,
and deleting the commit changes none of that.  So the audit is a hard gate: it
runs against the bytes in the repository working tree, not against the export
directory they were copied from, and a non-zero exit stops the run before
anything is committed.  There is deliberately no flag to skip it.

The same reasoning applies to the pipeline stages: if merging or rebuilding
failed, the data on disk is a half-written state and must not be published as
though it were a consolidation.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
-------------------
It never invents a remote, never force-pushes, and never commits anything under
`quarantine/`.  If tracked files have unrelated changes, it says so and
stops rather than sweeping someone else's edit into a commit. Untracked drafts
outside the output stay uncommitted and do not block the run.
