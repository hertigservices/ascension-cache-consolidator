"""Realm / game-mode taxonomy for Ascension cache submissions.

A client writes its caches to  Cache\\WDB\\enUS\\<Realm> - <Mode>\\ , so the directory
that directly contains a .wdb is the provenance unit.  This module turns that folder
name into (realm, mode) and a stable slug used for the published per-mode sections.

Three kinds of folder show up in real submissions:
  "Rexxar - Conquest of Azeroth"   -> realm + mode, the normal case
  "CoA QA"                         -> no separator; resolved by the OVERRIDES table
  "enUS" / "WDB" / archive stems    -> the user zipped from too high up; mode unknown,
                                       recoverable by fingerprint (see infer.py usage)

Edit modes.json (written on first run) to correct or extend the mapping without
touching code; it wins over the built-in defaults.
