"""Merge addon SavedVariables (.lua) submissions, and write them back as .lua.

Why this is a separate stage from merge.py
------------------------------------------
A .wdb cache is a flat list of independent records, so merging is set union on a
record hash. A SavedVariables file is a *tree*, and different branches of the
same tree need opposite treatment:

    MobSpellsDB.global.mobs      server-observed combat data  -> merge and keep
    MobSpellsDB.profileKeys      "<Character> - <Realm> - <Mode>" -> pure PII
    AIO_sv_Addons                server-pushed addon code     -> merge and keep
    AIO_sv                       hotbars keyed by character   -> character state

So there is no generic "merge two lua files" operation. Each supported file gets
an explicit spec below saying which globals hold the payload and how to combine
two readings of the same leaf. Anything not in the registry is not published at
all -- same allow-list rule as scrub.py, for the same reason.

The three merge shapes
----------------------
Deciding this per file is the whole job, because the same operation is right in
one file and destructive in the next:

  accumulator   MobSpells: `amountMin` is the smallest hit that submitter saw,
                so bounds widen and observed flags OR. Newest-wins would throw
                away a wider range someone else recorded.
  observation   Auctionator: an auction price was true at a moment and is not
                true now. Widening a price range says something nobody observed,
                so the newest capture wins outright.
  existence     GatherMate: a herb node is either there or not. Union, and a
                disagreement about what is at one spot is a conflict to report
                rather than a value to average.

Only the caches can be split per game mode -- the client files them in a
per-mode folder. Most of these addons keep one account-wide table with no record
of which realm an observation came from, and are published unsplit. Auctionator
is the exception: it keys its own database by "<Realm> - <Mode>", so it splits.
