"""Rebuild merged caches back into real, client-loadable .wdb files.

The decoded TSVs are for humans and databases; this is for the client.  For every
game mode we emit one .wdb per cache type containing the merged union of every
record that mode ever produced -- so a player drops in a cache that already knows
75,000 items instead of the ~40,000 any single submission held.

Header handling: the 24-byte header (magic, build, locale, recordSize, recordVersion,
cacheVersion) is copied VERBATIM from a real submitted file of that cache type, newest
first.  Those three trailing fields are client-version-sensitive and inventing them
risks the client rejecting or mis-reading the file, so we never synthesise them.

Records are written sorted by entry, then the 8-byte zero terminator the client
expects.  Sorted order is deterministic, so an unchanged store rebuilds byte-identical
and git sees no diff.

Every file written is re-parsed and compared payload-by-payload against what went in;
a mismatch is a hard failure, not a warning.

They are published gzipped -- see export.py; the merged season-10-freepick
itemcache alone is 254 MB, past GitHub's hard limit.  The gzip is verified to
decompress back to the exact bytes that were verified as a cache, so the two
proofs meet: what the reader unpacks is what we parsed.
