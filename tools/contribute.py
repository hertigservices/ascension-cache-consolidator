"""Package a contribution from your own Ascension install, ready to send.

WHAT THIS IS FOR

    Your client writes down every answer the server gives it -- what an item is,
    what a quest asks for, what an NPC says. Ascension is a live custom server,
    so those answers exist nowhere else. When a realm changes or closes, the only
    surviving copy is the one sitting in players' cache folders.

    This tool reads your install, keeps the parts that are game data, throws away
    the parts that are about YOU, and writes one small file you can send in.

    Point it at your Ascension folder:

        python contribute.py --install "C:/Games/Ascension"

    It prints exactly what it found and what it would send, and stops. Nothing
    is written and nothing leaves your machine until you look at that list and
    run it again with --write.

WHAT IT SENDS, AND WHAT IT WILL NOT

    Allowed, because a server sends the identical bytes to every player:
        the seven query caches -- item, creature, gameobject, quest, npc,
        pagetext, itemname
        five addon saved-variable files that hold observed game data

    Never, under any circumstances:
        itemtextcache.wdb -- the text of MAIL and letters people wrote to you
        anything else under WTF -- chat, macros, keybinds, combat logs, and a
        folder tree literally named after your login and your characters
        any file whose kind this tool does not recognise

    The rule is an ALLOW-list: a file travels only if its kind is known to be
    game content. Anything unfamiliar is left behind and listed as skipped. That
    is deliberately the opposite of a block-list, where forgetting one entry
    leaks it. scrub.py holds the policy and this tool defers to it entirely.

WHY IT DOES NOT MERGE ANYTHING

    It would be easy to make this tool merge your data into the public set and
    hand you the finished thing. It must not, for one reason: the archive's only
    real defence against bad data is counting how many INDEPENDENT people saw
    the same bytes. An item nine players' clients agree on is a fact. An item one
    submission asserts alone is a claim. If contributors sent merged results, a
    single sender would look exactly like a consensus, and that distinction --
    the one thing that makes poisoning hard -- would be gone.

    So this tool only ever describes what YOUR client saw. Merging happens once,
    centrally, where the count can be kept honest.

WHY THE FILE IT MAKES IS SO SMALL

    Almost everything in your cache is already in the archive. The bundle carries
    a fingerprint (entry id + sha1) for every record you have -- that is what
    gets counted for corroboration -- but the actual bytes only for records the
    archive has never seen. Pass --index pointed at a copy of the published
    cachedata/raw/ folder to get that saving; without it, everything is packed
    and the bundle is much larger, which still works.

WHAT COMES OUT

    A .zip holding
        manifest.json     what this is, which realm and mode, what was skipped
                          and why, and the record fingerprints
        new/<cache>.pack  only the records the archive did not already have
        lua/<name>.lua    the allow-listed addon files, scrubbed
    Open it. It is meant to be inspectable before you send it.
