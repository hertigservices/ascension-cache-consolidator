"""Cache Consolidator -- a tray app that watches the inbox and runs the pipeline.

    pythonw tools\\tray_app.py      (or double-click "Cache Consolidator.cmd")

WHAT IT IS FOR

    Drop a submission in _inbox and forget about it. While this sits in the tray it
    polls the inbox, waits for the drop to finish copying, files it under a name
    that cannot collide with anyone else's, runs the whole consolidate - audit -
    publish pipeline, and then moves the finished submission out of the way. Click
    the tray icon for a window with a live log and buttons for the manual commands.

WHY IT SHELLS OUT TO publish.py INSTEAD OF IMPORTING IT

    publish.py raises SystemExit on any git failure, and its own --watch loop has no
    guard around that: one .git/index.lock collision and the watcher is simply gone,
    with nothing left running to say so. Running it as a child process turns that
    into a non-zero exit code this supervisor can see, report and retry, and the
    tray icon survives it. It also keeps the published pipeline the one that is
    actually tested -- this file adds supervision, not logic.

WHY A FAILED RUN IS NOT MARKED DONE

    publish.py --watch records the inbox fingerprint whether the run succeeded or
    not, so a transient failure -- a GitHub hiccup, a lock collision -- leaves that
    submission unpublished until somebody happens to drop a different file. Here the
    fingerprint is recorded only after a clean exit; a failure retries on a backoff
    and says so.

WHY IT RENAMES ARRIVING ARCHIVES BUT NEVER LOOSE FILES

    intake extracts each archive into extracted/<stem>/ and, if that directory
    already exists, reports "cached" and moves on. Two submitters both sending
    WDB.zip therefore collide, and the second one is silently skipped -- which is
    why these have had to be renamed WDB(1).zip, WDB(2).zip by hand. So an arriving
    ARCHIVE is renamed to <stem>__<hash><ext>: unique per content, so two different
    WDB.zip files get two extractions and the same file dropped twice gets one.

    Loose .lua files are deliberately never renamed. luamerge matches them by exact
    filename against a five-name allow-list, so AIO_Client (1).lua is not a slightly
    wrong name -- it is an unrecognised file, dropped without comment.

    Files already in the inbox when the app starts are never renamed either.
    Renaming an archive that has already been extracted would give it a second
    extract directory holding identical bytes, and the corroboration counts that
    say "three people sent this record" would start counting one person twice.

WHY IT REFUSES TO RUN ELEVATED

    intake hands every submitted archive to 7-Zip, and a crafted archive can hold
    entries that resolve outside the extraction directory. When that was tested
    here, the escape failed because Windows refused to create the link WITHOUT
    ADMINISTRATOR -- not because 7-Zip or the intake code caught it. This app exists
    to point that pipeline at files strangers upload to a public Discord channel, so
    running it elevated would remove the only control that actually stopped the
    attack. It exits instead of asking.
