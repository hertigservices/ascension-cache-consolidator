"""Pre-publish audit: scan everything about to go public for data we LOST.

audit_publish.py asks whether the dataset contains something it must not.
This asks the opposite question, and it is the one that went unasked:

    Does the dataset still contain what it is supposed to contain?

WHY THIS EXISTS

    harvestmerge.to_py() folded a Lua mixed table's array part under a "_array"
    key.  Vendor prices live in the array part.  So info, costInfo and costs
    became unreachable, every price field fell through to its default, and
    3,791 vendor rows were published with money_cost, extended_cost,
    honor_cost, arena_cost and every cost_item column set to zero.

    Every existing check passed.  They had to: rebuild.py re-parses what it
    wrote, luamerge.py re-reads its own output, selftest.py compares published
    .wdb payloads against the client's own bytes -- and the .lua side of the
    dataset has no client bytes to compare against, because the game did not
    write it, an addon did.  Nothing anywhere compared the output against the
    SHAPE the data is supposed to have, so a field that quietly became a
    column of zeros looked exactly like a field that is genuinely zero.

    It is worth being precise about how bad that failure mode is: the loss was
    not merely undetected, it was written down as a finding.  A downstream
    importer read those zeros and recorded in its docstring that "every one of
    the 3,791 captured rows has ... every cost_item column set to zero.  That
    is a gap in the capture, not a discount."  A silent decoder bug had become
    a documented fact about the game.  That is the thing this file is here to
    make impossible.

WHAT IT CHECKS

  1. NO DEAD COLUMN      a .tsv column that holds the same nothing -- "", 0,
                         false, nil -- in every single row is a field nobody
                         decoded until someone writes down why it is empty.
                         This is the check that would have caught the bug: 14
                         of vendors.tsv's 22 columns tripped it.
  2. NO EMPTY TABLE      a .tsv with a header and no rows.
  3. NO DEAD BRANCH      a .json key path that is an empty list or dict at
                         every one of its occurrences.  wildcard.rollSpells
                         and wildcard.events were [] on every realm for the
                         same reason and nothing said so.
  4. NOTHING SHRANK      row counts, list lengths, and the number of rows in
                         which each column carries a real value, all compared
                         against a recorded baseline.  Growth is normal and
                         reported.  A DROP is a failure -- that is rollSpells
                         going 1,592 -> 7 and events 13,499 -> 116, which is
                         what "a list is replaced rather than unioned" looks
                         like from the outside, and it is money_cost going
                         413 -> 0, which is what the original bug looks like.

    A column constant at a real value is a note, not a failure.  Some fields
    honestly only ever hold one value and failing on those would train
    everyone to ignore this tool, which is the only way it can actually break.

    Check 4 is the load-bearing one, and 1 is how you get there.  Being empty
    is a property of the data and is often legitimate; BECOMING empty never
    is.  Check 1 fires on the first run and forces someone to say which of
    those two it is, once; check 4 then holds that answer to account forever,
    for every column, whether or not anything explains it.

EXPLAINING A FINDING RATHER THAN SILENCING IT

    tools/column_expectations.json holds the baseline and the explanations.
    An entry needs a reason in prose, because the reason is the deliverable:

        "constant": {
          "lua/harvest/vendors.tsv:cost_item_2": "No captured vendor item
              costs more than one currency, so the second and third cost
              slots are empty for every row. Verified against the pages
              themselves, not inferred from the column being empty."
        }

    Rewrite the reason when the data changes.  Do not add an entry to make a
    red line go away -- the entry IS the claim that you looked.

    python tools/audit_columns.py             check, exit 1 on any failure
    python tools/audit_columns.py --accept    record current counts as the
                                              baseline (do this only when you
                                              have read what changed)
