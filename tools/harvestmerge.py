"""Merge the WildcardHarvest SavedVariables -- vendor pages, gossip, and the
client's own reference tables.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODULE

    luamerge.py owns the registry and the file walk; this owns one spec whose
    tree is much larger and much more varied than the other five, and which is
    the only source in the whole archive for two kinds of data that no .wdb
    cache can hold:

      vendors   what an NPC actually had for sale, at what price, in what
                currency.  SMSG_LIST_INVENTORY is a live packet: the client
                answers it into the merchant frame and writes nothing to disk,
                so the only record that survives is an addon that read the
                frame while it was open.
      gossips   the text and options an NPC offered.  npccache.wdb holds the
                npc_text rows, but not which NPC uses which, nor the menu.

    Keeping it out of luamerge.py also keeps that file's diff small, which
    matters because another session edits it.

THE BRANCHES, AND WHAT EACH ONE GETS

    vendors           SNAPSHOT  per (realm, npc), newest capture wins
    gossips           SNAPSHOT  per (realm, npc), with $n restored
    advancement       PER REALM the Character Advancement node database
    wildcard          PER REALM roll statics, events and the roll spell pool
    byRealm           PER REALM the two above, plus API surfaces and skillCards
    enums             UNION     the client's own enum tables
    apiSurfaces       UNION     named item-id constants and API listings
    dungeons          UNION     dungeon table
    battlegrounds     UNION     battleground table
    skillCards        UNION     skill-card types and costs
    roleRequirements  UNION     role gating conditions
    version/captured  PUBLISH   provenance for the above
    spellsByChar      RE-KEYED  the spells are game data; the character is not
    identity          DROPPED   "<Character>@<n>" -> character state, nothing else

WHY advancement AND wildcard ARE NOT STATIC TABLES

    They look like reference data and they are not.  The same Character
    Advancement node is priced and gated differently per realm: over the eleven
    snapshots here, 15,004 fields disagreed when they were unioned into one
    table, and 14,978 of those disagreements went away the moment the realm was
    part of the key.  A union across realms does not merge two readings of one
    node, it invents a node that exists on neither realm.

    byRealm already carries the per-realm copy, so it is the one that is read;
    the top-level branches are the same tree for whichever realm the file was
    last saved on (byte-identical, checked across all 10,250 nodes) and are
    folded onto that realm.  Three of the eleven files predate byRealm and name
    no realm anywhere, so theirs goes under "(unattributed)" rather than being
    guessed onto a real one.

WHAT IS NOT A CONFLICT

    Four kinds of disagreement are not evidence of anything and must not be
    reported as such, because a merge that cries wolf 86,400 times is a merge
    nobody reads:

      lists       two sightings of a collection, so they union.  This one was
                  losing data outright: rollSpells went 1,592 -> 7 and events
                  13,499 -> 116, because a list was replaced by whichever file
                  merged last rather than added to.
      timestamps  a clock; the newest reading is just the newest.
      probes      calls.*, rapidRollingState, eligibility, tokens.  These are
                  what the API said about whoever happened to be logged in.
                  The single value is worthless and the SET of them is a
                  catalogue of the server's own gating reasons, so they are
                  collected into observed.json instead.
      zero        this harvester writes 0 for a field it has not observed, so a
                  non-zero reading is the only one that saw anything.

WHY VENDORS AND GOSSIP ARE SNAPSHOTS, NOT ACCUMULATORS

    luamerge's three shapes apply here too, and this is the *observation* one.
    A merchant page was true when the frame was open.  Field-merging two
    readings of the same vendor would produce a page that nobody ever saw --
    the union of two stock lists is not a stock list -- so the newest reading
    of a given (realm, npc) replaces the older one whole, and the older one's
    timestamp is kept in the report so the replacement is visible.

    The reference branches are the opposite: they are the client's static
    tables, so they deep-union and a scalar disagreement is a conflict worth
    printing rather than a value to average.

RESTORING $n RATHER THAN REDACTING IT

    Gossip text arrives with the *server's* $n already substituted by the
    client, so a line the server wrote as "Greetings, $n." is on disk as
    "Greetings, Onichan."  Blanking it would lose the sentence; leaving it
    would publish a character name.

    The file names its own characters, in the identity branch, which is the
    one branch we refuse to publish.  So identity is read first and used as the
    substitution key -- every character name this submitter played is put back
    to $n -- and then dropped.  After that a second pass re-scans every string
    we are about to publish for any of those names and refuses the whole file
    if one survived, because a silent miss here is a leak.

    Substitution is word-boundary only.  A character named after a common word
    would otherwise rewrite the game's own text, and mangling server prose to
    protect a name that is not really there is its own kind of data loss.
