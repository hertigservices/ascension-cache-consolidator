"""Turn the merged record store into a publishable dataset tree.

Three views over the same merged records, because they answer different questions:

  by-mode/<mode>/<cache>.tsv   what a client running THAT mode was actually sent.
                               Authoritative for values: Ascension tunes the same
                               item differently per mode, so this is the table to
                               import if you care about numbers.
  union/<cache>.tsv            widest coverage -- every entry we have ever seen,
                               newest capture wins, with the mode and date it came
                               from in _modes/_captured.  Use it to answer "does
                               entry N exist", not "what are its stats on my realm".
  raw/<cache>.pack.gz          lossless.  Every distinct payload, byte for byte, so
                               a better decoder can be run over it later without
                               re-collecting anything.  Deterministic ordering, so
                               regenerating an unchanged store produces an identical
                               file and git sees no diff.

Winner rule within a view: newest last_captured, ties broken on sha1 so output is
stable.  Losing variants are never deleted -- they stay in raw/ and in the index.

EVERYTHING BULKY IS GZIPPED
---------------------------
Uncompressed this dataset is ~756 MB and its largest single file is a 254 MB
itemcache -- GitHub warns over 50 MB and hard-rejects over 100 MB, so it simply
could not be published.  Gzipped it is ~104 MB with nothing over 16 MB, and the
reader needs no tooling we do not already ship: `gzip -d`, any language's
standard library, or `tools/unpack.py`, which also drops a mode's caches
straight into a client cache folder.

mtime=0 on every write, because gzip otherwise stamps the clock into its header
and an unchanged rebuild would then show up as a diff in every single file.
